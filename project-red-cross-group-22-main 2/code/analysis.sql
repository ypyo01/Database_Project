-- PART D: Analysis: 
-- Question 1: Visualize the number of volunteers available by city (according to their
-- volunteer range, note: a volunteer can be available in more than 1 city)
-- compared to the number of volunteers that applied for a request in that city.
-- Whatâ€™s the city with the most (top 2) volunteers and the least (bottom 2)?
-- Make sure your visualization gives a good overview of the current situation
-- and quickly shows the most information.

-- Question 2: Create your own scoring system to calculate the matching percentage
-- from all the attributes of a volunteer that you find relevant: e.g: interest, travel
-- readiness, volunteer range, number of skill matches, etc. Make a compelling
-- case for your scoring scheme and suggest a top 5 candidates for each
-- request according to this system. 

-- Step 1: Calculate Skills Match Score

    FROM Volunteer_Area_Of_Interest vai
    JOIN Request r ON vai.interest_name = r.title

-- Question 3: For each month, what are the number of valid volunteer applications
-- compared to the number of valid requests? What months have the most and
-- least for each, how about the difference between the requests and
-- volunteers for each month? Is there a general/seasonal trend? Is there any
-- correlation between the time of the year and number of requests and
-- volunteers? See analysis.py.
